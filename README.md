# Ken McTran -- Exploratory Data Analysis with Jupyter Notebooks

## Purposes
    The purpose of this repository  is to implement steps 1->9 of the project.
    See documentation here for details: https://nwmissouri.instructure.com/courses/71203/discussion_topics/582071 

## Workflow:
    Repeatable workflows include the following:
    1. Follow best-practices for git-update-push to ensure workable code are regularly checked-in into cloud-based Github repository.
    2. python3 -m venv .venv  <!-- On Mac, this step create a local .venv directory to install tool into --> 
    ## On Mac, next 2 lines install needed tools (documented in requirements.txt ) into .venv environment
    3. python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    4. python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    5. 1. source .venv/bin/activate <!-- On Mac, this command would activate the environment -->
    6. At terminal, use the command "code ~/Repos/datafun-04-eda" to launch VS Code (previously installed on MAC) to open/edit/execute code related to this project.
   
## Within VS Code (on Mac):
    click on "Run All" on the "tran-notebook.ipynb" to execute both Markdown & Python cells within a .ipynb notebook.
    
## Within the file tran-notebook.ipynb
    Since this is a *.ipynb file, within VS Code or via a browser, read annotated sections of observations and graphs.
